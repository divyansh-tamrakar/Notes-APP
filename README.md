# Notes-APP

the Project is in master branch

For this project I followed a video by Dennis Ivy on youtube. for the most part I knew the django code but not the React part so that is copied in a way. I am unbeknownst to React but I might learn it in near future.

NOTE : in the project's frontend part, the js files are full of syntactical errors due to the misplaced tags. Idk why it happened and I downloaded some extentions just before the video so maybe an extention broke. 
 

# TO RUN THE PROJECT 
  
clone the repository and open the project in VS Code 
- open a new terminal 
- run command 'python manage.py runserver' and this will bring up the django server, to view the api enter the url 'localhost:8000/api' and you'll find it
- to run the website open a new terminal and change directory to frontend by typing the command 'cd frontend'
  - then type the next command 'nmp start'
  - and just wait for a few seconds then on the port 3000 (url 12.0.0.1:3000) the website will be available
- to access the admin panel of the backend (django): 
  - open the terminal and type the command 'python manage.py createuser'
  - then type in your username, passwords and email.
  - then go to localhost:8000/admin and login 

thank you <3
